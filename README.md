# proj6-college-recipes-HTML-CSS
Recipes I have successfully recreated and cooked during my college days

Skills I wish to demonstrate using HTML & CSS: 
- Create a layout style that is suitable for web browsers. Sizing is not considered.
- Have a rough outline of my recipes and organized them from the notes.
- Have dropdown menus.
- Image sizing and arranging float boxes.
