# college-recipes
Recipes I have successfully recreated and cooked during my college days

Skills I intended to finish demonstrating using HTML and CSS: 
- Create a layout style that is suitable for web browsers. Sizing is not considered yet
- Have a rough outline of my recipes and organized them from the notes.
- Successfully dropdown menus as well as image size and floats.
