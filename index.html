  <h1>Eaindra's recipes</h1>
  <p>Most of my cooking is done with instinct during my college days. Whenever I asked my mother for exact 
    measurements, she never gave me a specific amount, so I learned how to measure it instinctively later on as well. 
    Some of the recipes will not have any measurements due to it.
