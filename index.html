            <p>Most of my cooking during college days was done purely by instinct. 
                Whenever I asked my mother for precise measurements, she never gave me a straight answer, 
                so I ended up learning how to gauge things intuitively as I learned how to cook.
                As a result, some of my recipes don't come with any measurements at all. 
                It's all about going with the flow and trusting my culinary instincts!
