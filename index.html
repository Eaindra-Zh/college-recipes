  <h1>Eaindra's recreated recipes</h1>
  <p>Most of my cooking during my college days was done purely by instinct. 
    Whenever I asked my mother for precise measurements, she never gave me a straight answer, 
    so I ended up learning how to gauge things intuitively as I learned how to cook.
    As a result, some of my recipes don't come with any measurements at all. 
    It's all about going with the flow and trusting my culinary instincts!
