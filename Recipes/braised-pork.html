  <h1>Braised pork or Hong-Ba (as our family called it)</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    One of our family's traditional Chinese dish that my mother used to make often.
    Might be a little off-putting to people who does not like oily dishes (due to the pork fat)
    but you can make it with as little oil as possible too. Paired with a bowl of rice, 
    with <a href="cucumber-salad.html">cucumber salad side-dish</a>...
    Chef's kiss.
