  <h1>Cucumber Salad</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    A refreshing and spicy dish to pair with something oily or just a bowl of fried rice!
    I came upon this dish while I was craving cucumber but don't want to just eat it raw as it is. 
    Original recipe is from 
    <a href="https://carlocao.com/spicy-korean-cucumber-salad-oi-muchim/#recipe"><em>Carlo Cao</em></a>
    With limited ingredients at my disposal, I had to get creative.
    So, the following ingredients and measurements are what I ended up using.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Half a cucumber (the usual one you can get at Jumbo or Lidl)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
    <li>Some sugar</li>
    <li>Some water</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place a cucumber between two chopsticks.</li>
    <li>Cut straight slices from top to bottom, the chopsticks create a barrier to prevent you from cutting through.</li>
    <li>Then flip the cucumber so that the uncut side faces up and cut them in 45 degrees, 
        placing them in between chopsticks as well.</li>
    <li>For the sauce, mix all the ingredients (including sesame seeds) in a bowl...
        For the amount of water, I just go with how much the sauce thins out. I don't want it to be too thin,
        but at the same time not too thick that I cannot pour it over the cucumber. 
    </li>
    <li>Pour the sauce over cucumbers, and leave it in the fridge for 30 minutes. The longer the better. </li>
    <li>You can serve it with anything really, if you like cucumber. </li>
  </ol>
