  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Vegetarian dumplings for one of our friends! She doesn't eat meat, so has to make do with vegetable for the fillings. 
    The original recipes can be found here, on <a class= "lk" href="https://biancazapatka.com/en/vegetable-dumplings-vegan-gyoza/#recipe">this website</a>, 
    with steps on how to make both the wrap and the fillings. But I just buy the wrapping and make the fillings. 
    Easier and less effort!

    Pretty sure I didn't follow the recipe to a T, but here's the list of ingredients.
